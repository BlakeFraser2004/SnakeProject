## Game Overview

This game is a modern and more effecient re-creation of the highly popular and recognisable game, "SNAKE" widely appreciated on older devices from the late 90s and early 2000s. 

## Features

- Classic gameplay, very similar to the origina game.
- A growing snake that gets longer as it eats food.
- Collect triple point fruit which add 3 unit to your length instead of one!
- Beware of the Walls !
- Keep track of your high score.
- If your score is embarrassing you can always clear it !
- Responsive and intuitive controls.

## How to Play

1. **Objective**: The objective of the game is to control the snake and eat as much food as possible without colliding with the walls.

2. **Movement**: The snake moves continuously in the direction it's facing. Use the arrow keys to change the snake's direction.

3. **Eating Food**: When the snake's head touches a food item (indicated by the red objects and yellow objects with 1 and 3 points resepctivley), it consumes the food and grows longer.

5. **Collision**: Avoid collisions with the walls. Colliding ends the game!

6. **Scoring**: Your score is determined by the number of food items eaten.

## Controls

- **Arrow Keys**: Use the arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right) to change the snake's direction.
