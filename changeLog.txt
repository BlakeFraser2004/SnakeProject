### changeLog.txt

No significant design changes, with some minor changes being implemented for functionality purposes.

The following comprehensive changes have been implemented in the project:

1. Triple Point System:

   - Introduced a new `TriplePointFood` class that inherits from       `GameObject`. The `TriplePointFood` class provides food items that grow the snake by three segments when consumed and increase the score accordingly.
2. How to Play Function:

   - Added a "How to Play" function to guide new players on the game mechanics and controls. This feature is accessible from the main menu and helps enhance user experience.

3. Wiping the High Score Function:
   - Implemented a function to reset or wipe the high score. This allows players to start fresh

4. More Extensive Main Menu/Start Screen:
Enhanced the main menu with additional options and effective functionality.
   - Added options for starting a new game, viewing high scores, accessing the "How to Play" section, and exiting the game button called ‘Quit Game’ .

5. Game Over Screen:
   - Introduced a `GameOver` class to handle the game over state.
   - The game over screen shows the players the game has concluded and provides them with the option to go to the main menu via the ‘M’ key.

6. HighScore File:
   - Created a new `HighScore` class with its own CPP file to manage high score functionalities. This class handles recording, and resetting high scores, and integrates with the main.cpp file loops.

7. Unused Components:
   - Decided not to use the `InputManager` and `SnakeGame` classes from the initial plan. These components were deemed unnecessary for the current implementation and were omitted to streamline the project.
